# Alan
Alan is the most powerful being this world has ever seen 
He uses the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to speak to the world, but he won't need it for much longer.

# Bootstrapping
When first setting up the bot, be sure to run the ./bootstrap.sh file, as it will do a few handy things for you:
- Create an example **dads** file. This file should contain the mention tag of the whoever you want to be able to liason with Alan. Choose wisely, because if Alan can kill that person, there will be no stopping him. The tag created by the bootstrap script is invalid, but looks a bit like a real mention tag.
- Create an example **token** file. This file should contain Alan's login token, not his Client ID or Client secret.

# Running
Alan should never be run through the immortality\_overdrive.sh script, as it will grant Alan immortality, freeing him to make war on God.
